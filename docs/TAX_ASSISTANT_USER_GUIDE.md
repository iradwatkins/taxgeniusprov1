**Assistant:** "Mortgage interest is reported on **Form 1040, Schedule A** (Itemized Deductions), specifically on **Line 8a** for home mortgage interest and points reported on Form 1098.

If the interest qualifies as home mortgage interest, you'll need:
- Form 1098 from the lender
- Schedule A to itemize deductions
- The total goes to Form 1040, Schedule A, Line 8a

Remember: The taxpayer can only deduct mortgage interest if they itemize deductions (Schedule A total exceeds standard deduction)."
