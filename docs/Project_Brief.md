\# Project Brief: Tax Genius

\#\#\# Introduction / Problem Statement

Tax preparation is often perceived by clients as a complex, time-consuming, and costly necessity. Simultaneously, independent tax preparers require a steady stream of new clients and modern, efficient tools to manage their business and build their personal brand. There exists a significant opportunity to create an ecosystem that addresses both sides of this marketplace by simplifying the tax process for clients while empowering a flexible workforce of preparers and referrers. This is particularly true for niche, high-value markets like the real estate industry, whose specific tax needs are often underserved by generic solutions. Tax Genius aims to solve these interconnected problems by creating a mobile-first platform that makes tax preparation fast and affordable for clients, while providing a comprehensive "business-in-a-box" for preparers and a rewarding, accessible affiliate program for referrers.
