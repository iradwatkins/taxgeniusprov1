\# PRD User Interface Design Goals

\#\#\# Overall UX Vision

The user experience must be clean, modern, and incredibly intuitive, prioritizing speed and ease of use. The platform should feel trustworthy and professional, while also incorporating gamification elements to feel engaging and rewarding for Referrers. The design will be mobile-first and fully responsive.

\#\#\# Key Interaction Paradigms

\* \*\*Role-Based Dashboards:\*\* The core of the PWA will be a dashboard that fundamentally changes its layout, tools, and information presented based on the logged-in user's role (Client, Referrer, Preparer).  
\* \*\*Guided Workflows:\*\* All complex processes, especially tax document submission for clients and onboarding for new referrers, will be broken down into simple, step-by-step guided flows.  
\* \*\*One-Click Sharing:\*\* Referrers will have access to pre-made marketing materials that can be shared to social media or via messaging apps with a single click.

\#\#\# Core Screens and Views

\* \*\*Public-Facing:\*\* Homepage, Lead-Gen Landing Pages, "Become a Preparer" Page, "Join our Referral Program" Page.  
\* \*\*App/User-Facing (Post-Login):\*\* Login Screen, Role-Based Dashboards (Client, Referrer, Preparer), Merchandise Store, Contest/Leaderboard View.

\#\#\# Accessibility

A baseline of WCAG 2.1 AA is required to ensure the platform is usable by people with disabilities.

\#\#\# Branding

The visual identity will be based on the "Tax Genius" branding, utilizing a professional color palette of dark blue, green, and white, as seen in the marketing mockups provided.

\#\#\# Target Device and Platforms

A single Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to be fully responsive and functional across all modern browsers on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices (iOS and Android).
