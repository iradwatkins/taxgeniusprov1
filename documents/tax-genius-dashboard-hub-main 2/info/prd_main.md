\#\#\# Goals and Background Context

\#\#\#\# Goals

The primary goal of the Tax Genius software platform is to serve as the engine for the company's strategic growth. The platform must be built to scale the business to over 1,000 clients, improve tax preparer team performance, and lay the foundational framework for a future franchise model.

To achieve this, the MVP of the software will focus on supporting the following core business pillars and 90-day quick wins:

\* \*\*Business Infrastructure:\*\* Create a system that supports a 3-tier preparer system (Trainee, Certified, Top Performer) and integrates with CRM tools to manage client leads and onboarding.  
\* \*\*Recruitment & Training:\*\* Launch a "Tax Genius Academy" feature set to serve as a lead magnet and training platform for new preparers, with the goal of recruiting 50 new preparers in the first 90 days.  
\* \*\*Marketing & Lead Generation:\*\* Implement a robust client acquisition engine to support paid social media ad campaigns and an expanded referral program, with the goal of growing to 500+ clients in 90 days.  
\* \*\*Branding & Automation:\*\* Build automation for the client journey, including drip campaigns and features that enable cross-selling of new services like credit repair and bookkeeping.  
\* \*\*Franchise Planning:\*\* While not an MVP feature, the platform's architecture must be designed with the long-term capability of supporting a franchise model.

\#\#\#\# Background Context

With a history dating back to 1999, Tax Genius is evolving from a traditional tax service into a modern, technology-driven "tax lifestyle" brand. The company's strategy is to build a comprehensive ecosystem that not only serves tax clients with speed and accuracy but also empowers a remote workforce of tax preparers through training, tools, and a clear career progression. The software platform is the cornerstone of this strategy, designed to automate the client journey, scale recruitment, and provide the operational infrastructure needed for rapid growth and future franchising.
